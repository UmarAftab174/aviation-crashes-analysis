# Aviation Crashes Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes global aircraft incidents from 1908 to 2019 through an interactive dashboard visualization system. The analysis examines crash patterns, fatalities, survival rates, and contributing factors across different operators, aircraft manufacturers, and historical periods.

## Features
- Comprehensive analysis of 4,863 crashes and 109,794 fatalities
- Interactive dashboards showing:
  - Temporal analysis of crash frequencies and survival rates
  - Operator classification and performance metrics
  - Manufacturer safety records
  - Causation patterns and their impact

## Technical Implementation
- **Data Preprocessing**: Python scripts using Pandas for:
  - Missing value handling
  - Feature engineering (Passenger-Crew Ratio, Survival Rate, Company categorization)
  - Creation of derived metrics (Severity Score, Aircraft Size Category)
  
- **Visualization**: Power BI dashboards providing:
  - Primary cause distribution analysis
  - Operator type impact assessment
  - Timeline correlations
  - Incident outcome distribution
  - Aircraft size impact analysis

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI

## Project Structure
- Data preprocessing script
- Power BI dashboard file
